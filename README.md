# Elements the Typology
Welcome to "Elements the Typology" wiki!
"Elements" are based on assymetrical tetrachomies from analytical psychology, which defines person's <b>Rhetorical Appeal</b> and <b>Interaction style</b>

<h1> Elements </h1>
Person's main Element shows how person usually interact with others:
<ul> <li><b> Fire </b> — order and control their subordinates to get results faster. They collect resources and direct them to the cause. </li> <li> <b>Water</b> —  support their subordinates and direct their work from behind the scenes. They praise their employees, adapt to changes, and resolve technical issues. </li> <li> <b>Air</b> — discuss different options, brainstorm, and discover new opportunities for their teams. They involve others in their work and help them come up with new ideas. </li> <li> <b>Earth</b> —  develop an action plan, plan everything down to the smallest detail, and monitor the work of others. They direct their team's efforts to achieve their goals. </li>  </ul>
<h1> Appeal </h1>
Person's Appeal describes person appeal:
<ul> <li><b> (Thinking)[[https://itsbuzzbug.github.io/Thinking]]</b>  – an appeal to logic and reason, engaging the intellect, analysis, and structured argumentation. It does not necessarily imply strict logical correctness but rather focuses on presenting a coherent rationale that persuades through evidence, cause-and-effect reasoning, and systematic thought; </li> <li> <b>Loving </b> – an appeal to emotions, values, and ideals, aiming to create resonance with the audience’s sense of meaning, harmony, and shared human experience. It should not be mistaken for mere emotionality; rather, it seeks to evoke sentiments that align with the message’s intent and significance; </li> <li> <b>Immutable </b>– an appeal to credibility, authority, and established norms, reinforcing the necessity of maintaining objective values, societal principles, and ethical considerations. It encompasses adherence to rules, duty, trustworthiness, and the pragmatic aspects of decision-making, such as needs and logistics; </li> <li> <b>Fatal  – </b>  an appeal to the opportune moment and the urgency of action, emphasizing the right time, circumstances, and resources necessary for effectiveness. It engages with motivation, readiness, and the dynamic interplay between opportunity and execution, stimulating action based on situational awareness and strategic timing. </li>  </ul>
